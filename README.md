## 📖 Abstract

Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name, thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce  class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We will release the code publicly.

### Dataset Structure

#### Raw Dataset Files

Place your downloaded datasets according to the expected paths in each dataset's implementation file. For example:
- Skin40: `$HOME/Data/skin40/` with `train_1.txt`, `val_1.txt`, and `images/` directory
- CIFAR100: Automatically handled by torchvision
- Other datasets: Check the respective dataset class in `datasets/` for expected paths

#### Class Descriptions (Included in Repository)

Each dataset should have its class descriptions stored in `datasets/class_descs/{DATASET_NAME}/`:
- `description_pool.json`: Dictionary mapping class names to lists of LLM-generated descriptions
- `unique_descriptions.txt`: List of unique descriptions used for training

Example structure:
```
datasets/
  class_descs/
    CIFAR100/
      description_pool.json
      unique_descriptions.txt
    Skin40/
      description_pool.json
      unique_descriptions.txt
```

**Note**: The class description files are already included in this repository and do not need to be downloaded separately.

### Generating Class Descriptions (Optional)

If you want to generate your own class descriptions using LLMs, you can use the concept generation tool located in `methods/concept_generation/`. This is an independent module that:

- Generates visual concept descriptions using LLM APIs (OpenAI GPT models)
- Implements a similarity-based filtering mechanism to prevent redundant descriptions
- Supports batch processing and different prompt types (medical, default, CT, etc.)
- Converts description pools to index-based format for efficient storage

**Note**: The pre-generated descriptions in `datasets/class_descs/` are ready to use. You only need to run this tool if you want to generate new descriptions or modify existing ones.

## 🎯 Usage

### Training

1. Configure your experiment in a YAML file under `config_yaml/CLIP_Concept/`:
```bash
python main.py --yaml_path config_yaml/CLIP_Concept/cifar100.yaml
```

2. Or specify parameters directly via command line:
```bash
python main.py \
    --yaml_path config_yaml/CLIP_Concept/cifar100.yaml \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --epochs 10 \
    --lr 0.002
```

### Evaluation

Set `is_train = False` in `main.py` to evaluate a trained model:
```python
is_train = False
```

The evaluation script will load checkpoints from the specified save path and evaluate on all tasks.

### Generating Visual Concepts

The `methods/concept_generation/` module is an independent tool for generating LLM-based visual concept descriptions. This tool is used to create the class descriptions that are later used in the main training pipeline.

#### Setup

1. Install additional dependencies:
```bash
pip install openai scikit-learn nltk
```

2. Download NLTK data (required for text preprocessing):
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
```

3. Configure API credentials:
   - Edit `description_generator.py` and set your OpenAI API key and base URL
   - Or set environment variables for API configuration

#### Usage

1. Prepare a category file:
   - Create a text file listing all class names (one per line or as a Python list)
   - Example files are available in `methods/concept_generation/datasets/`

2. Run the concept generation:
```bash
cd methods/concept_generation
python main.py
```

3. Configure the generation in `main.py`:
```python
data_info = {
    "path": "datasets/skin8.txt",  # Path to category file
    "need_type": "all",  # "all" for single prompt type, "mixed" for multiple types
    "need_description": {
        "type": "default"  # Prompt type: "default", "medical", or "ct"
    },
    "batch_size": 2  # Number of classes to process per batch
}
```

4. Convert description pool to index format:
```bash
python convert_description_pool.py
```

This will generate:
- `description_pool_v{N}.json`: Description pool after each batch
- `unique_descriptions.txt`: List of all unique descriptions
- `description_pool_indices.json`: Index-based format for efficient storage

#### Features

- **Similarity-based Filtering**: Automatically filters redundant descriptions using TF-IDF and word overlap metrics
- **Batch Processing**: Processes classes in batches to manage API rate limits
- **Multiple Prompt Types**: Supports domain-specific prompts (medical, CT scans, default)
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies and removes conflicting descriptions within and across categories
- **Automatic Pooling**: Maintains a target number of descriptions per class (default: 5)

#### Output Format

The generated files follow the same format as those in `datasets/class_descs/`:
- `description_pool.json`: `{"class_name": ["concept1", "concept2", ...]}`
- `unique_descriptions.txt`: Python list of all unique descriptions
- `description_pool_indices.json`: Index-based mapping for efficient storage

After generation, you can copy these files to `datasets/class_descs/{DATASET_NAME}/` for use in the main training pipeline.
